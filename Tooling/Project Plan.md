# Identify Tasks

Based on the goals and deliverables defined in the [Project Charter](Tooling/Project%20Charter.md) make a list of all items that have milestones or tasks associated with them.

Identify what tasks must be completed to achieve each item by

- reviewing previous similar projects
- asking for emails regarding other similar project
	- this helps find relevant people
	- this gives insights into the process
- talking to stakeholders, team members, and vendors
	- brainstorm with team members who are likely perform the tasks
	- hold one on one conversations with team members who are likely to be responsible for performing the task

# Acquire Domain Knowledge

Domain knowledge includes relevant specialized knowledge such as terms, techniques, and processes unique to the industry or segment the project is servicing.

Gain domain knowledge by

- conducting online research
	- searching blog posts , corporate communication , news , research
	- identifying issues and how they managed them
	- identifying successes and how they implemented them
	- using keywords such as "best practices" and "key takeaways"
	- researching similar projects in other industries
- talking to stakeholders, team members, and vendors

based on your list of items
- research the specifics of executing each item

# Fill In Gaps

If there are still areas with task uncertainty you can reach out to senior stakeholders.

Talk to key stakeholders with med to high power and high interest. Use a [Stakeholder Interest Matrix](Tooling/Stakeholder%20Interest%20Matrix.md) to identify them.

Prior to meeting with them
- gather all pertinent information for them
- outline clearly the questions you need answers to
- present research you have performed and the current list of tasks

This will help them see where there are gaps and how they can help.

# Synthesize Details

Each project will vary in the amount of details necessary to include in a task list.

As the project manager it is up to you to decide the appropriate level to provide for each task when putting together the project plan.

Goal should always be for tasks to be concise and clear.

# Order Tasks

- determine their natural order
- do they have prerequisites
- do they have dependencies

Ask individual team members what needs to happen before they can begin their work.

Use a spreadsheet to order the tasks.

|Task|Duration Estimate|Notes|
|--|--|--|
|task 1|||
|task 2|||

# Determine Milestones

Milestones are 
- points in the project where you and your team can evaluate the work completed up to that point
- tasks that certain stakeholders are particularly interested in
- tasks that signal the completion of a phase

# Get Estimates

Obtain estimates from team members on how long it will take to complete tasks.

- confirm team member understands the task being asked about
- get estimates for all sub steps of the task
- sum sub steps estimates to get estimate of task
- discuss assumptions made for a given estimate
	- what equipment do they assume they will have
	- what supplies do they assume they will have
	- how many people and what are their skills and experience
	- ask team member to consider how likely it is that the assumptions wont be met and how that will affect the estimate given
- compare estimates given against actual time spent on similar tasks from prior projects
	- ask what was different and what was the same
	- considering those differences does that change the given estimate

Be empathetic.

- Ask for their opinion, do not give it to them. Do not suggest your own estimates. Instead ask them how long a similar task took them on a previous project.
- Repeat what they said in your own words. This allows them to confirm that they communicated what they intended and allows them to gain a bit of insight into your perspective.
- Connect with their experience. Let them know you understand making estimates is difficult. Share how you also struggle with estimates and have even missed the mark. And it's ok, we just want to get the best estimate possible.
- When asking for estimates be mindful of your preconceptions and judgements.
- Recognize buffers. Ask if they included buffers for things such as holidays, sickness, emergencies. This helps them recognize that you understand their position and can help get a better estimate.

## Three Point Estimates

Method for estimating task duration.

Considers best case and worst case scenarios as well as risk to calculate the estimate.

Each task receives three time estimates.

- optimistic : no issues , ideal circumstances
- most likely : few issues , normal circumstances
- pessimistic : many issues , catastrophic circumstances

Also describe the conditions for each estimate.

- optimistic : conditions
- most likely : conditions
- pessimistic : conditions

**Example**

Task : Equip each CSR with a tablet.

|Scenario|Estimate|Conditions|
|--|--|--|
|optimistic|2 hours|staff is fully trained , software works as intended|
|most likely|4 hours  + 1 day delay|not all staff is present so need to schedule more time for training , software underperforms in some areas but mostly adequate|
|pessimistic|4 hours + 1 week delay|staff turnover prior to training , wrong software delivered|

## Final Estimate

Do not schedule solely based on the pessimistic scenario. This will lead to excess time that could have been used for other tasks or for an earlier launch.

Instead compare optimistic and pessimistic against most likely and include a buffer that covers likely risks while maintaining project progression.

Use a formula such as [Triangular](#Triangular) or [Pert](#Pert).
## Triangular

Use when unsure of the probability for each scenario.

`(Optimistic + Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 3`
## Pert

Use when the most likely scenario is believed to be most probable.

`(Optimistic + (4 x Most Likely) + Pessimistic) / 6`

## Confidence Rating

Indicates confidence in an estimate's accuracy.
The communicates your certainty for a given estimate.

Reported as high, medium, low.

Some methods for calculating confidence ratings

- use a three point technique
- poll the team on how confident they are on the estimate they each gave , have them report this as a % , then convert % to high, medium, low
- poll the team on how often they have done this type of task before, never, sometimes, many, then convert to high, medium, low

Include notes on any issues or concerns you found in arriving at the estimate.

|Task|Duration|Confidence|Notes|
|--|--|--|--|
|task 1|2 days|High||
|task 2|3 days|Low||

# Negotiate Estimates

When negotiating with a task expert the goal is

- to obtain an accurate time and effort estimate for a task
- not to persuade them to agree to a particular estimate

Expect good intentions.

- over estimating may be due to expert being cautious
- under estimating may be due to expert wanting to meet your expectations

You want to negotiate to arrive at realistic and objective estimates.

Techniques

- say no without saying no
	- do not use negative language such as that wont work, we can't do that
	- instead use positive language such as how can we proceed, what can I do to help
	- this helps get the other person to work on alternate solutions with you
- focus on interests not on positions
	- identify their needs & motivations for completing the task
	- gauge and ask what areas they are able to compromise on and to what degree
- present mutually beneficial options
	- discover information they are missing or resources they require to arrive at a shorter estimate
	- provide these items
- insist on objective criteria
	- research, prior project docs
	- agree beforehand on which resources will be used as objective criteria
	- consult those resources to determine the estimates
	- if expert wants to follow their instincts ask them beforehand to provide clear and supportive data to validate their estimates
