## Executive Summary

Our goal was to help users organise their notes. We made a system that automatically sorts and saves their notes into different groups.

During beta testing we helped 1000 users organise over 30,000 notes in 3 months. At the conclusion of testing 58% of the users signed on to a paid plan. At 3/month that converted to 174 in monthly revenue.

The main user feedback we received from the beta users was they wanted offline access. This is something we want to address moving forward.
