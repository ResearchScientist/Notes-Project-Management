Waterfall is a linear approach.

- initiate
- plan
- execute
- close

Agile is an iterative approach.

# Focus

Focus on

- continuous feedback
- dynamic requirements
- fast deliverables

# Themes

## Delivery

Deliver quickly to obtain feedback faster.

- satisfy user with early useful delivery
- working software is the primary measure of progress
- simplify , maximize the amount of work not done

## Collaboration

Make communication between members effortless.

- welcome changing requirements
- these changes result from the user and gives us the competitive advantage
- developers and other stakeholders work together daily or weekly

## Team Dynamics and Culture

Have an inclusive team culture.

- feels motivated to do the right thing
- feels trusted to do the right thing
- has the resources and space to work closely together on their goals
- works at a constant and sustainable place
## Retrospectives and Continuous Learning

Have a space for team reflection.

- at end of milestones
- discuss how to be more effective
- adjust behaviour accordingly
- adapt to what's working and what's not working

# Scrum

- sprints
- daily scrums

Pillars

- transparency
- inspection
- adaptation

Values

- commitment
- courage
- focus
- openness
- respect

Roles

- scrum master : build fast
- product owner : what to build
- development team : build

Teams are self organizing.

# Kanban

- visually displays workflow via columns
- allows team to see what is being worked on
- allows team to see what is being prioritized

# XP

- minimize design to meet the core requirements
- write concise code
- test exhaustively to eliminate flaws prior to building
- gather user feedback
- pair programming
- CI/CR
- embed requirements into the tests

# Lean

- define value : ;focus on user needs
- map value stream : identify production steps and eliminate wasteful ones
- create flow : ensure product flows through the value stream efficiently
- establish pull : ensure the user is asking for features and deliveries
- pursue perfection : drive team to continuously improve on the above steps

# Backlog

A document containing items to be worked on.

- living document
- items ordered by priority

- description : item description
- value : value to the user or org
- order : priority number
- estimate : effort to complete the task

Effort Estimates can be a size

- small
- medium
- large

or can be a relative unit
such as a fibonnacci sequence in which as numbers get larger the distance between them is greater

- 1
- 3
- 5
# User Stories

- user
- action
- value

Use a persona to briefly tell one user story. The story should be

- independent
- negotiable
- valuable
- estimable
- small
- testable

Each story offers focus for a sprint.

## Acceptance Criteria

A checklist to determine when a user story is complete.
This includes all the items that a user will need in order to complete their story.

- [ ] item one
- [ ] item two
- [ ] process one
- [ ] process two
- [ ] deliverable one
- [ ] deliverable two

# Epic

A group of user stories.

# Sprint

Time blocked focus for a task.

- usually 1 to 2 weeks, can be longer
- backlog
- goal

# Stand Up

15 minute meeting

# Sprint Review

- team discusses what they accomplished
- team shows their mvp release as a product increment

# Sprint Retrospective

From 15 minutes to 3 hours. Conducted at the end of a sprint.

# Sprint Velocity

How many story points a team tends to burndown during a given sprint.  This is calculated by averaging at least three sprints. (100 pts / 4 sprints = 25 velocity)

The velocity is different between different teams and thus is not used for comparison. Instead it is used to measure the team's unique pace.

Once the team's sprint velocity is known it can be used to
- predict how long work will take to complete
- predict how much of the backlog can be completed by a certain time

# Value Driven

Deliver a product that is useful to the user.

- build the right thing : solve the root problem
- build it right : deliver features the user uses
- run it right : support the user throughout their journey and experience with the product

# Value Roadmap

Map of the development process.

- vision
- high level product brief and requirements
- milestones schedule
- release schedule

Each planned release includes

- the release goal
- backlog items
- estimated release date
- other key dates that impact the release

Review the planned release prior to the sprint to ensure the viability of sustainable capacity and velocity.


# Change Management

Implementing a procedural change is an incremental process.

- find a stakeholder who feels a change of ownership and buy in for the change you're implementing
	- this ally will help motivate the team
- create a sense of urgency , ask
	- what is preventing us from providing the best product to our users
	- what is allowing our competitors to outperform us in this sector
	- how can we help our teams be more productive and supported
	- these questions help the team see the benefit of the change and get buy in


# Scrum Master

- design the play book with the team
- provide feedback
- celebrate the team

# Proactive Damage Control

- pay attention to signs of distrust between teams
	- address by conducting a solution design sprint so everyone sees how each team contributes and they all benefit
- be aware of team's ad hock work load
	- when on a sprint and other manager asks team members to do a task ask manager to come directly to you instead so you can schedule their request and thus not interrupt the teams workflow and velocity
- look for signs of low morale, or high conflict or low conflict between team
	- run a team brainstorming session on how to work better together
		- ask them to write story on best team they worked on and worst team they worked on, then share in the meeting, then make a list of do's and don'ts based on the stories
	- introduce fresh workflows to change things up
	- take a training session on team work together
	- conduct a 6 hat retrospective


# Six Hat Retrospective

- blue hat - 1 minutes
	- Discuss objectives for the session.
- white hat - 5 minutes
	- Raise and discuss anything from the last iteration. Facts and information.
- yellow hat - 5 minutes
	- Discuss good things that happened.
- black hat - 5 minutes
	- Discuss bad things that happened, frustrations, breakdowns and such.
- green hat - 5 minutes
	- Discuss solutions and ideas on what may add value to the process.
- red hat - 2 minutes
	- Share emotive statements. How do you feel.


## Solution Design Sprint

A solution design sprint is a sprint dedicated to working on drafting the design of the solution. Involve all teams working on the project and gather everyone's feedback.
