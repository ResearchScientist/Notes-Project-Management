Do not make the interaction about you. Instead make it about them and how they benefit. 

Influencing is a negotiation. Be patient, do not be pushy. It may take multiple interactions to influence someone.
## Power

Sources that boost your influence.

Organizational

- role : position in the project
- information : level of access and control over information related to the project
- network : other people with varying degrees of power you are connected with
- reputation : perception by others

Personal

- knowledge : expertise, abilities, and skills
- expressiveness : ability to communicate
- history : amount of time people know you
- character : other's views of your qualities

## Excitement

Influencing someone should not be a burden or a task. It should be exciting. You have an idea you want to share. You're excited about your idea. Help them understand how your idea relates to them so they can be excited too.
