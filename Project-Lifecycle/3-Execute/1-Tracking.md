# Project Schedule

Use a [Gantt Chart](3-Schedule.md#Gantt%20Chart) to view the schedule of tasks and their dependencies.

Include it in the [Project Charter](Project%20Charter.md).
# Progress Towards Milestones

Use a [Roadmap](Roadmap.md) to view how a project will evolve over time.

Include it in the [Project Charter](Project%20Charter.md).
# Status of Action Items

Use a [Burndown Chart](Burndown%20Chart.md) to view time against the work done vs work remaining.

Include it in the [Project Charter](Project%20Charter.md).
# Changes

Types of changes include new, removed, or different

- dependencies
- priorities
- capacities
- resources
- budget

When encountering a change a new action needs to be implemented. A change request form is used to document the change that has occurred and the required resources to accommodate the change.

# Dependencies

- Internal : related tasks within the same project
- External : tasks related to factors outside of the project or related to other projects
- Mandatory : tasks required due to regulations or contracts
- Discretionary : unrelated tasks that the project team decided to relate them

## Dependencies Management

- identify dependencies : brainstorm with team to identify and categorize
- record dependencies : enter dependencies into a [Risk Register](Risk%20Register.md)
- monitor dependencies : via check ins and meetings
- communicate dependencies : via meetings

# Risks

Use a [Risk Exposure Matrix](Risk%20Exposure%20Matrix.md) for tracking risk exposure.

<mark style="background: rgb(100,100,200)">The example given seems to be the same as a risk register. This does not show exposure.</mark>


## ROAM

Method for managing a live risk.

- resolved : no longer a threat
- owned : assigned to a team member (need to monitor)
- accepted : take the hit from the unresolved risk
- mitigated : probability has been reduced or impact has been reduced

Enter risks into a table for sorting and prioritizing.
