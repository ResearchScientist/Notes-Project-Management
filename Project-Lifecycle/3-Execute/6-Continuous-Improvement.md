- goals
- resources
- scope
- timeline
## Measure

- obtain data
- define performance metrics
- establish baseline
## Analyze

- find root causes of defined problem
- understand their impact

## Plan

- identify the problem
- identify the cause
- brainstorm solutions
## Do

- on a small sample or small scale test one of the brainstormed solutions
- do this just long enough to obtain good metrics
## Check

- monitor the solution's impact
- compare the solution's results with the established goal
- report on findings
## Act

- if the small scale solution returned good results then implement the solution at scale
