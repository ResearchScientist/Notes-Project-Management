# Quality Management

A few examples of project management processes that can be used within a quality management plan for ensuring and managing quality.

**Continuous Improvement**

- identify
- plan
- execute
- review

**DMAC**

- define
- measure
- analyze
- improve
- control

**PDCA**

- plan
- do
- check
- act

The quality management plan itself consists of 

- [Quality Standards](#Quality%20Standards)
- [Quality Process](#Quality%20Process)
- [Quality Assurance](#Quality%20Assurance)
- [Quality Control](#Quality%20Control)

# Quality Standards

These are the requirements, specifications or guidelines that ensure the product or service will meet the project's goals. These may include reliability, usability, and product standards.

Consult project documentation such as the [Project Charter](../../Tooling/Project%20Charter.md) to begin a list of quality standards.

A small representation of quality standard categories

- customer satisfaction
- design
- duration (equipment failure) (software upgrade)
- effectiveness
- functionality
- productivity
- safety
- usability

When identifying quality standards make sure to define them with measurable and objective goals. Use quantitative and/or relative comparisons when defining them.
# Quality Process

Determine the process for identifying which quality standards are relevant to the project. 

Ask questions such as

- what outcome do users expect
- what does quality look like to them
- how can we meet their expectations
- how will we determine if the quality measure will lead to success

Consult with stakeholders and domain experts.

You can also conduct industry research to find other quality standards relevant to the project.
# Quality Assurance

Is a review process that occurs throughout the project lifecycle. 

## Schedule

Schedule regular audits to confirm that

- procedures are being followed
- plan is on track

Schedule regular check ins.

## Evaluate

Evaluate quality standards in order to learn and inform decisions by

- gathering data
	- beta testing
	- feedback surveys
	- internal checklists
- measuring data
- comparing data to previously agreed upon criteria

Results will inform

- if a process is effective or if it should be improved or changed
- if a product is working as intended
- if the project is causing any unintended problems while being implemented

Your role is to implement solutions around these findings in order to move the project forward.

**Evaluation Process**

- determine the reasons for evaluation
	- ie quantify quality of product or process
	- ie improve a training process
- keep in mind how aspect you're evaluating connects to project goals
- evaluation questions focus on either
	- improvements
		- what's working and not working
		- what are the most common participant reactions
	- measurements and comparisons
		- results and outcomes , intended or unintended
		- lessons learnt
- make sure questions
	- address stakeholder or user values, interests, and concerns
	- are relevant to the project's purpose
	- are practical and feasible given the allotted project resources

**Evaluation Indicators**

The specific data types required to answer the evaluation questions. Think of these as the markers that indicate the direction that tasks are heading towards as they relate to the evaluation questions. Evaluation indicators are the metrics that indicate if you are meeting a goal.

EQ : to what extent does the software improve user performance
- EI : faster completion rate
- EI : increased number of completed tasks

## Evaluation Findings

Gather the raw data recovered from the evaluation.

- filter and analyze data
- look for patterns and anomalies
- have different people look for patterns and anomalies

Once you determine what the data is informing relate that information to the evaluation questions and the project goals.
## Report

Report evaluation findings to pertinent stakeholders via

- summary sheet
	- 1 or 2 pages 
	- snapshot view
	- only most relevant information to target audience
- slide deck
	- visual representation of findings

## Presentation

Do not present just the raw data. 

Instead
- explain what the data means
- how it informs a response to the evaluation questions
- shape the story of the evaluation findings into one cohesive narrative 

Make sure to cover the
- points you want to make
- questions you want to answer
- concerns you want to address

The goal of the presentation is to demonstrate to stakeholders if the project is successfully meeting quality standards.


Begin presentation with the overall purpose and goal of the project.
Present milestone that's being evaluated and how it's expected to meet the project goals.
Explain what the relevant data revealed.
Inform on major issues the data surfaced.
Summarize the rest of the data.


# Quality Control

Ensures quality standards when an issue arises or if the quality plan is not executed appropriately by employing corrective actions.

# Documentation

Use a [Quality Management Plan](../../Tooling/Quality%20Management%20Plan.md) to document and outline the project's procedures you determined for

- [Quality Standards](#Quality%20Standards)
- [Quality Process](#Quality%20Process)
- [Quality Assurance](#Quality%20Assurance)
- [Quality Control](#Quality%20Control)
