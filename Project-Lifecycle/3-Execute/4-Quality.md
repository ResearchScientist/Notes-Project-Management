# Quality Management

## Quality Standards.

These are the requirements, specifications or guidelines that ensure the product or service will meet the project's goals. These may include reliability, usability, and product standards.

Consult project documentation such as the [Project Charter](../../Tooling/Project%20Charter.md) to begin a list of quality standards.

A small representation of quality standard categories

- customer satisfaction
- design
- duration (equipment failure) (software upgrade)
- effectiveness
- functionality
- productivity
- safety
- usability

When identifying quality standards make sure to define them with measurable and objective goals. Use quantitative and/or relative comparisons when defining them.
## Quality Process

Determine the process for identifying which quality standards are relevant to the project. 

Ask questions such as

- what outcome do users expect
- what does quality look like to them
- how can we meet their expectations
- how will we determine if the quality measure will lead to success

Consult with stakeholders and domain experts.

You can also conduct industry research to find other quality standards relevant to the project.
## Quality Assurance

Is a review process that occurs throughout the project lifecycle. 

### Schedule

Schedule regular audits to confirm that

- procedures are being followed
- plan is on track

Schedule regular check ins.

### Evaluate

Evaluate quality standards in order to learn and inform decisions by

- gathering data
	- beta testing
	- feedback surveys
	- internal checklists
- measuring data
- comparing data to previously agreed upon criteria

Results will inform

- if a process is effective or if it should be improved or changed
- if a product is working as intended
- if the project is causing any unintended problems while being implemented

Your role is to implement solutions around these findings in order to move the project forward.
### Report

Report to stakeholders.
## Quality Control

Ensures quality standards when an issue arises or if the quality plan is not executed appropriately by employing corrective actions.

# Documentation

Use a [Quality Management Plan](../../Tooling/Quality%20Management%20Plan.md) to document the project's

- [Quality Standards.](#Quality%20Standards.)
- [Quality Process](#Quality%20Process)
- [Quality Assurance](#Quality%20Assurance)
