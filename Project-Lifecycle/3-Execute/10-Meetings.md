# Stakeholder Meeting

Goal is to get buy in from stakeholders.

Stakeholder meetings are more formal than other meetings.
Meetings can be in a large group setting or one on one.
For large groups focus on the key stakeholder's needs. 

## Format

- present project update
- obtain feedback
- make a decision / resolve major issue

Frequency of meeting can be a regular occurrence or a one time only meeting.

# Retrospective

Retrospectives are usually conducted after key milestones, sprints, launches, and landings.

A retrospective's goal is to identify the contributing causes of an incident or pattern of incidents. The goal is not to blame individuals.

Benefits of a retrospective include team building, collaboration, and positive change.

The process and outcome of the retrospective should be positive. You want to identify improvements. You want everyone to feel empowered and hopeful about the project.
## Empower

Make a safe space for the team.

- Inform them that the purpose is to learn how to improve the process not to blame anyone for anything.
- Let them know what is said in the room stays in the room. Only solutions leave the room.
- Do not include users or stakeholders , that should help the team open up about problems they might not otherwise voice.

Model the types of responses you want to elicit.

- Give examples of your own successes from other projects.
- Give examples of your own challenges from other projects.
- Mention a mistake you made on the project and how you will avoid similar errors going forward.
## Accountability

Bring specific challenges you found that you want to discuss as a group. This is important to do so the retrospective does not focus solely on the successes but also discusses the issues that lead to the challenges and discusses their solutions. 

- Have the team think about the series of events that led to the challenge.
- Push the team to identify a moment in the series of events where they missed an opportunity to recognize and address the problem.

## Balance

Set a positive tone at the start of the meeting.

Begin by talking about the successes.

When asking for feedback hand out an equal amount of green cards and red cards. This encourages a balance between successes and challenges.

Meet one on one with team members prior to the retrospective to anticipate any potential negativity that might come up.

If you feel that a particular team member might bring in negativity to the meeting ask yourself

- does this member feel insecure about the value they bring to the team
- does this member receive negative feedback on the quality of their work
- reassure the team member of their worth and contribution

If one team member is dominating meeting with negativity

- instead of posing a question to the group , ask each team member to share their thoughts
- this shares the space with everyone involved
- this models solution thinking for the other members

If negativity is escalating

- de escalate by calling for a break
## Questions

Questions to ask based on my personal weekly retrospective

- what went well and why
- what didn't go well and why
- what to continue and why
- what to stop and why
- what to start and why

Answering the why is key in improving any processes.

Other questions.

- how is the team doing
- are the users happy
- are there processes we could optimize
- are our tools working for us
- are we following the values
- are we accumulating any debt , technical or otherwise

You can pose a question to the whole group and ask for each individual's response.

If the team responds with only recent examples then review the project timeline so they can consider examples farther out.
## Format

Provide an agenda for the retrospective. 

Include sections for
- discussion guide
- meeting outline
- learnings

Retrospectives can be conducted as 

- a team meeting
- one on one
- via a survey (public or private for confidential feedback)

Do not use you language or name individuals, instead name the issue or the process.

## Action Items

At the conclusion of the retrospective have a section for capturing action items. These are in response to questions such as lessons learned. They can also be in response to complaints and issues found.

Make sure to document the action item and define it as a SMART action item.

Example

Issue : One team member feels left out of decision making.
Action Item : Invite team member to weekly meeting with agenda item for team member to discuss issues and get feedback. Check in with team member after 1 month to find out if team member still feels left out or not.
