# Retrospective

Retrospectives are usually conducted after key milestones, sprints, launches, and landings.

A retrospective's goal is to identify the contributing causes of an incident or pattern of incidents. The goal is not to blame individuals.

The process and outcome of the retrospective should be positive. You want to identify improvements. You want everyone to feel empowered and hopeful about the project.
## Questions

Questions to ask based on my personal weekly retrospective

- what went well and why
- what didn't go well and why
- what to continue and why
- what to stop and why
- what to start and why

Answering the why is key in improving any processes.
## Format

Retrospectives can be conducted as 

- a team meeting
- one on one
- via a survey (public or private for confidential feedback)

Do not use you language or name individuals, instead name the issue or the process.

## Action Items

At the conclusion of the retrospective have a section for capturing action items. These are in response to questions such as lessons learned.
