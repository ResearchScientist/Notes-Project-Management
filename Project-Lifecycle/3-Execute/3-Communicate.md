Communication channels depend on the type of information and on who is receiving the communication.

- Email : For small changes that affect one individual.
- Team Meeting : For a large change that impacts the whole team , such as a change in schedule, scope, or budget.

# Retrospective

A retrospective's goal is to identify the contributing causes of an incident or pattern of incidents. The goal is not to blame individuals.

Questions to ask based on my personal weekly retrospective

- what went well and why
- what didn't go well and why
- what to continue and why
- what to stop and why
- what to start and why

Answering the why is key in improving any processes.
