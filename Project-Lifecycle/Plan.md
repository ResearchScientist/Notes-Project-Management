Planning the project together in the early stages helps the team members get buy in into the project.

- set the schedule
- make a budget
- make a risk management plan

First step is the [Kick Off Meeting](Kick%20Off%20Meeting.md).
Next is milestones and tasks.
Then setting the schedule.

# Milestones

A project consists of various milestones. These milestones indicate the progress towards completion of the project.

Breaking down the project into milestones allows for visualizing its individual components. This helps prioritize and design the workflow and timeline.

Assign a realistic deadline to each milestone based on the complexity of tasks and allotted resources. Align with stakeholders expectations and communicate any scope modifications that need to be made to meet those expectations.
# Tasks

Each milestone consists of various tasks. These tasks must be completed in order to reach the milestone.

Determine the order of tasks with a [Work Breakdown Structure](Work%20Breakdown%20Structure.md).

## Task Assignment

Assign tasks based on team member roles. Consider their expertise and current workload.

# Schedule

An outline of the time allotted for all tasks and the roles responsible for them.

Include

- project start date
- project end date
- tasks start and end dates
- tasks and their assigned roles
- milestones
- phases
- granulize as necessary into months, weeks, days, hours

A gantt chart is a good choice.

To get appropriate time estimates for the tasks, ask the role assignee how long it will take.

You can add buffers to tasks, but best to use them for external stakeholders such as vendors. That way if they are late on delivering you can still be on schedule because you added a buffer to account for such a delay.

For internal stakeholders use buffers only on the more complex tasks. 

# Capacity

Determine if the allocated resources are adequate for completing the tasks on time.

- Identify which tasks can be performed in parallel. These can be scheduled simultaneously.

- Identify which tasks can only be performed sequentially. These must be scheduled early on to allow for their sequence to complete on time.

- Identify tasks with fixed start dates.

- Identify the earliest start date for tasks. This is the earliest date that a task can start, usually dependent on other tasks or external stakeholders such as vendors. This can impact the duration and resources required to complete the task on time.

- Identify if a task has any slack. Those without any slack belong on the critical path.

# Critical Path

The critical path consists of the minimum milestones necessary for the project to be considered a success.

- List all milestones and their corresponding tasks, these can be gathered from the [Work Breakdown Structure](Work%20Breakdown%20Structure.md).
- Identify dependencies between tasks.
- Determine duration for each task.

The longest path found is the critical path.
