Evaluate and identify risks and issues.

# Identify Risks

Conduct a brainstorming session.
- use a fishbone diagram (cause & effect diagram) to work backwards identifying first the possible risks and then the causes of those risks

Conduct a risk assessment.
- use a probability and impact matrix to determine the inherent risk of each risk
- use a risk register (a table listing all the risks) to tabulate and sort the risks

**Probability and Impact Matrix**

![pm-prob-imp-mtx](pm-prob-imp-mtx.png)

The intersection of the probability and impact of a risk gives its inherent risk. Also expressed as low med or high.

You only want to concern yourself with inherent risks that have a medium or high rating.

**Risk Register**

Include a description of the risk, its inherent risk rating, and how the risk can be mitigated.

## Important Risk Types

- time risks : task may take longer than anticipated
- budget risks : cost may increase due to poor planning or scope expansion
- scope risks : project may not produce the results outlined in the project goals

## External Risks

- environmental
- regulatory

Form contingencies for dependencies. Dependencies cannot begin until their linked action is complete.
