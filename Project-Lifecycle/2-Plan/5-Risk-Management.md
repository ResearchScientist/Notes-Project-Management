Evaluate and identify risks and issues.

# Identify Risks

Conduct a brainstorming session.
- use a fishbone diagram (cause & effect diagram) to work backwards identifying first the possible risks and then the causes of those risks

Conduct a risk assessment.
- use a probability and impact matrix to determine the inherent risk of each risk
- use a risk register (a table listing all the risks) to tabulate and sort the risks

Use a [Fishbone Diagram](Fishbone%20Diagram.md) to visualize the causes and effects of risks.

Use a [Probability and Impact Matrix](Probability%20and%20Impact%20Matrix.md) to obtain inherent risk levels. You only want to concern yourself with inherent risks that have a medium or high rating.

Use a [Risk Register](Risk%20Register.md) to sort risks based on inherent risk and their mitigation plan.

**Important Risk Types**

- time risks : task may take longer than anticipated
- budget risks : cost may increase due to poor planning or scope expansion
- scope risks : project may not produce the results outlined in the project goals

**External Risks**

- environmental
- regulatory

Form contingencies for dependencies. Dependencies cannot begin until their linked action is complete.

# Mitigate Risks

- avoid : take action that eliminates the risk
- accept : monitor the risk and if it does occur you are ok with its impact
- reduce : determine options , use a decision tree
- transfer : move risk from one owner to another

# Risk Management Plan

A living document detailing the mitigation plans for high level risks.

- continuously add newly identified risks
- remove no longer relevant risks
- include any changes to mitigation plans

Template for a [Risk Management Plan](Risk%20Management%20Plan.md).

# Communicate Risks

Communicate early and often with stakeholders about med and high level risks.
This sets realistic expectations and offers an opportunity for you to make appropriate requests for mitigation.

## Email

**Low Level**

- Include low level risks in a weekly update.
- Briefly address how you will address them if they arise.

**Medium Level**

- Send high level risks in a direct email to the stakeholder.
- Urgent in the heading.
- Give more detail than a weekly update. Provide link to risk management plan.

## Meeting

**High Level**

- add agenda item to project plan meeting 
- agenda item is to present the high level risks and their mitigation plans
- get feedback on risk management plan
- ask for insights from stakeholders on how to handle these high level risks
