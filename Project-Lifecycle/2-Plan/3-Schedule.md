A schedule is an outline of the time allotted for all tasks and the roles responsible for them.

Include

- project start date
- project end date
- tasks start and end dates
- tasks and their assigned roles
- milestones
- phases
- granulize as necessary into months, weeks, days, hours

## Gantt Chart

A gantt chart is a good choice for visualizing the full project schedule.
It displays the tasks, milestones, duration, and important dates.

# Time Estimates

To get appropriate time estimates for the tasks, ask the role assignee directly.

Use open ended questions
- how long does a task like this typically take
- how complex is this task
- what risks are associated with this task
- when do you think you can have this ready

Provide help
- what do you need to complete this sooner

# Buffers

You can add buffers to tasks, but best to use them for external stakeholders such as vendors. That way if they are late on delivering you can still be on schedule because you added a buffer to account for such a delay.

For internal stakeholders use buffers only on the more complex tasks. 

# Capacity

Determine if the allocated resources are adequate for completing the tasks on time.

- Identify which tasks can be performed in parallel. These can be scheduled simultaneously.

- Identify which tasks can only be performed sequentially. These must be scheduled early on to allow for their sequence to complete on time.

- Identify tasks with fixed start dates.

- Identify the earliest start date for tasks. This is the earliest date that a task can start, usually dependent on other tasks or external stakeholders such as vendors. This can impact the duration and resources required to complete the task on time.

- Identify if a task has any slack. Those without any slack belong on the critical path.

# Critical Path

The critical path consists of the minimum milestones necessary for the project to be considered a success.

- List all milestones and their corresponding tasks, these can be gathered from the [Work Breakdown Structure](Work%20Breakdown%20Structure.md).
- Identify dependencies between tasks.
- Determine duration for each task.

The longest path found is the critical path.

Use a [Network Diagram](Network%20Diagram.md) to identify and visualize the critical path.
