# Identify Recipients

Use a [RACI Matrix](RACI%20Matrix.md) and [Stakeholder Interest Matrix](Stakeholder%20Interest%20Matrix.md) to identify who needs to receive the communications.

# Follow Up

Not everyone responds to the same form of communication.
To track communication effectiveness send an email or poll.

- what is working
- what is not working
- where can improvements be made

# Information Storage

- store in a central hub that is easy to access
- not everyone needs access to the full documentation
- provide adequate level of detail for different stakeholders
- allow for access when you are not available or need to transfer ownership
- protect sensitive data
- protect personal information
