# Milestones

A project consists of various milestones. These milestones indicate the progress towards completion of the project.

Breaking down the project into milestones allows for visualizing its individual components. This helps prioritize and design the workflow and timeline.

Assign a realistic deadline to each milestone based on the complexity of tasks and allotted resources. Align with stakeholders expectations and communicate any scope modifications that need to be made to meet those expectations.

# Tasks

Each milestone consists of various tasks. These tasks must be completed in order to reach the milestone.

Determine the order of tasks with a [Work Breakdown Structure](Work%20Breakdown%20Structure.md).

## Task Assignment

Assign tasks based on team member roles. Consider their expertise and current workload.
