# Project Goals

The desired outcomes of the project.

Defines SMART goals.

- specific
	- what do we want to accomplish
	- what are the constraints
	- avoid subjective comparative words such as bigger or better
- measurable
	- by how much
	- compare against established industry benchmarks
	- many of these metrics are industry specific
- attainable
	- are resources, time, budget adequate
- relevant
	- do project goals align with overall organization goals
	- set up project OKRs to align with organization OKRs
- time bound
	- set a duration
	- set a completion date

# Scope

The boundaries of the project.

- which project elements are the stakeholders aligned on as in scope
- do stakeholders disagree on any of the elements
- are there any elements that should be designated as out of scope

# Benefits

The expected gains of the project and to the organization.

Such as
- financial gain
- customer satisfaction

# Costs

Expenditures.

- assets
- time
- resources

Work with stakeholders and vendors to identify all expected expenditures.

Tip: 
If you can, visually represent how the benefits outweigh the costs.

# Budget

An estimate of the money allocated to complete the project.

# People

Try not to assign people to the project.
A better strategy is to motivate people to want to join your project.

- conduct a survey
	- what are the pitfalls and risks
	- what do you see as a problem
	- responses clue you in on who would want to get involved
- keep team to a small number
	- this increases accountability
	- identify key stakeholders
	- finesse personality conflicts so they can work together

# Stakeholder Analysis

Visual representation of

- stakeholders
- stakeholder priorities
- communication preferences
- needs
- goals

Identify how much influence each has on the project.
Identify how much their needs (interest) will be affected by the project operation and outcomes.

Use a [RACI Matrix](../../Tooling/RACI%20Matrix.md) and [Stakeholder Interest Matrix](../../Tooling/Stakeholder%20Interest%20Matrix.md) to visualize these relationships.

Adapt your negotiation strategy to each.

# Negotiate

Get alignment amongst stakeholders as early as possible to avoid the need for negotiating changes later on.

Things that may require negotiation
- scope
- costs and benefits
- schedule
- success criteria
- roles and responsibilities
- resources
