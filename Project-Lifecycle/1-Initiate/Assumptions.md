Assumptions are gathered during the Initiate Phase.

# Identify Assumptions

Assumptions are beliefs or expectations about key factors necessary for the success of the project.

Each assumption should be specific and directly relevant to the project.

Identify assumptions by

- holding stakeholder brainstorming sessions and interviews
- holding team brainstorming sessions
- having one on one conversations
- reviewing docs
	- [Risk Register](../../Tooling/Risk%20Register.md)
	- [Risk Exposure Matrix](../../Tooling/Risk%20Exposure%20Matrix.md)
	- [Project Charter](../../Tooling/Project%20Charter.md)
- researching industry
- asking vendors to document their assumptions

For a given assumption spell out its opposite. If nonsensical then assumption holds no value and there is no need to include it.

If data source for the assumption is a 
- survey
- opinion
- focus group
then test and validate the assumption.

No need to validate assumptions with data sources that have already been vetted.

# Prioritize Assumptions

Facilitate a mapping activity for identifying and prioritizing assumptions.

Have group write assumptions on a sticky note.
Vote as a group on likeliness and impact for each assumption and place on board.

|high likeliness / low impact|high likeliness / high impact|
|--|--|
|low likeliness / low impact|low likeliness / high impact|

Prioritize high likeliness + high impact assumptions.

Can also use different headings such as risk vs effort to validate.

|high risk / low effort| high risk / high effort|
|--|--|
|low risk / low effort|low risk / high effort|

Prioritize high risk + low effort assumptions.

# Document Assumptions

Once the assumptions have been identified and prioritized log them into a document.

The [Assumptions Log](../../Tooling/Assumptions%20Log.md) is a living document that gets updated as new assumptions are added and as the status of existing assumptions change.

Another tool that can be used to document assumptions is a [RAID Log](../../Tooling/RAID%20Log.md).

Regularly review the log with relevant stakeholders to ensure accuracy and alignment with project goals.

# Track Assumptions

Follow up on  high risk  / high likeliness assumptions to confirm that the assumption did not occur or if it did that the mitigation plan was enacted and was effective.

Document the outcome and close the assumption.
