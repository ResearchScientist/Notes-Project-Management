# Identify Tasks

Based on the goals and deliverables defined in the [Project Charter](Tooling/Project%20Charter.md) make a list of all items that have milestones or tasks associated with them.

Identify what tasks must be completed to achieve each item by

- reviewing previous similar projects
- asking for emails regarding other similar project
	- this helps find relevant people
	- this gives insights into the process
- talking to stakeholders, team members, and vendors
	- brainstorm with team members who are likely perform the tasks
	- hold one on one conversations with team members who are likely to be responsible for performing the task

# Acquire Domain Knowledge

Domain knowledge includes relevant specialized knowledge such as terms, techniques, and processes unique to the industry or segment the project is servicing.

Gain domain knowledge by

- conducting online research
	- searching blog posts , corporate communication , news , research
	- identifying issues and how they managed them
	- identifying successes and how they implemented them
	- using keywords such as "best practices" and "key takeaways"
	- researching similar projects in other industries
- talking to stakeholders, team members, and vendors

based on your list of items
- research the specifics of executing each item

# Fill In Gaps

If there are still areas with task uncertainty you can reach out to senior stakeholders.

Talk to key stakeholders with med to high power and high interest. Use a [Stakeholder Interest Matrix](Tooling/Stakeholder%20Interest%20Matrix.md) to identify them.

Prior to meeting with them
- gather all pertinent information for them
- outline clearly the questions you need answers to
- present research you have performed and the current list of tasks

This will help them see where there are gaps and how they can help.

# Synthesize Details

Each project will vary in the amount of details necessary to include in a task list.

As the project manager it is up to you to decide the appropriate level to provide for each task when putting together the project plan.

Goal should always be for tasks to be concise and clear.

# Order Tasks

- determine their natural order
- do they have prerequisites
- do they have dependencies

Ask individual team members what needs to happen before they can begin their work.

Use a spreadsheet to order the tasks.

|Task|Duration Estimate|Notes|
|--|--|--|
|task 1|||
|task 2|||


# Determine Milestones

Milestones are 
- points in the project where you and your team can evaluate the work completed up to that point
- tasks that certain stakeholders are particularly interested in
- tasks that signal the completion of a phase
